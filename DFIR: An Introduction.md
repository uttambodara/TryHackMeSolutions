# DFIR: An Introduction | TryHackMe

**Hey all, this is the thirty-ninth installment in my walkthrough series on TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1 path which covers the first room in this module on Digital Forensics and Incident Response,
where we will come to understand what forensic artifacts are present in the Windows and Linux Operating Systems, 
how to collect them, and leverage them to investigate security incidents.**

**This is an introductory room for the DFIR module.**

**How do forensic investigators get their daily probiotics? By drinking their DFIR...**


# Task 1: Introduction

**Learning Objectives**

**Security breaches and incidents happen despite the security teams trying their best to avoid them worldwide. The prudent approach in such a scenario is to prepare for the time when an incident will happen so that we are not caught off-guard. Thus, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) has become an essential subject in Defensive Security. In this room, we will cover some basic concepts of DFIR and introduce rooms that expand on our knowledge of DFIR. The room will cover the following topics:**

- Introduction of DFIR
- Some basic concepts used in the DFIR field
- The Incident Response processes used in the industry
- Some of the tools used for DFIR

# Task 2: The need for DFIR

**2.1 What does DFIR stand for?** 


Answer: ``Digital Forensics and Incident Response``

---

2.2 DFIR requires expertise in two fields. One of the fields is Digital Forensics. What is the other field?

Answer: ``Incident Response``

# Task 3: Basic concepts of DFIR

**3.1 From amongst the RAM and the hard disk, which storage is more volatile?**

Answer:`` RAM``

**3.2 Complete the timeline creation exercise in the attached static site. What is the flag that you get after completion?**


Answer: ``THM{DFIR_REPORT_DONE}``

# Task 5: The Incident Response process

**5.1 At what stage of the IR process are disrupted services brought back online as they were before the incident?**


Answer: ``Recovery``

**5.2 At what stage of the IR process is the threat evicted from the network after performing the forensic analysis?**

Answer: ``Eradication``

**5.3 What is the NIST-equivalent of the step called “Lessons learned” in the SANS process?**

Answer: ``Post-incident Activity``


**Task 6: Conclusion**

That was all for this room. Let’s reiterate what we learned here.

We learned what DFIR is and where it is used.
We learned why we need to perform DFIR.
We learned the basic concepts like the chain of custody, evidence preservation, and order of volatility.
We learned about some of the tools used in the industry like EZ tools, KAPE, Autopsy, etc.
The PICERL process for incident response
Now we can move to the next rooms in this module to learn more about DFIR. Let us know what you think about this room on our Discord channel or Twitter account. See you around.
